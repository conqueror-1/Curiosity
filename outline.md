# Intrinsic Motivation Mechanisms in Artificial Agents: A Literature Review

## I. Introduction
### A. Background on Intrinsic Motivation

Intrinsic motivation refers to the spontaneous tendency "to seek out novelty and challenges, to extend and exercise one's capacity, to explore and to learn" [Richard Ryan et al](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5364176/#:~:text=Intrinsic%20motivation%20refers%20to%20the,70)

In Artificial Intellegence systems, intrinsic motivation is applied to agents so that agents can generate their own rewards based on their internal states and the perceived value of their actions. If the system is based on extrinsic motivation then the reward is provided by the external source. 

### B. Purpose of the Review

One of the recent publications titles "MOTIF: INTRINSIC MOTIVATION FROM ARTIFICIAL INTELLEGENCE FEEDBACK" [Martin Klissarov et al](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.00166) inspired this exploration. 

The authors had a challenging research question where they had to make an agent make decisions in an environment where the agnet had no prior knowledge. 
They proposed a general method for such problems which included grounding LLMs for decision making. "It elicits preferences from an LLM over pairs of captions to construct an intrinsic reward, which is then used to train agents with reinforcement learning". They then evaluated this proposed model's ie MOTIF's performance on the game NetHack with that of a procedural algorithm written to get the max score in the game. They then combined the environmental rewards to that of MOTIF's. This then outperformed the procedural algorithm.
